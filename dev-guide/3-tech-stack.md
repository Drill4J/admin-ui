# Technical stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as main programming language.

We use [React](https://reactjs.org/) as a rendering library.

We use [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) as a routing library.

We use [@redneckz/react-bem-helper](https://github.com/redneckz/react-bem-helper) as utility helps to declare BEM entities in terms of React components.

State management library is still TBD.
